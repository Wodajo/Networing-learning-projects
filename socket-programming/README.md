For now I've made a simple Server and Client scripts working on TCP.

Client should work fine on Linux, Win and MacOS.
Server needs testing on Win and MacOS.
Header is waaaay to big, but 64 bytes is not that much of a burden.

## TO DO:
- make reasonable header
- chatting app?
- "grab a file and send it" app?
- UDP versions
